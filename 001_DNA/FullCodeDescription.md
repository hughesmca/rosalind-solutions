Define Nucleotides
  The four DNA bases are defined as    Adenine (A)
                                      Cytosine (C)
                                       Guanine (G)
                                       Thymine (T)
                                       
Create Random String
  Range is defined as total base strand count. I.E. range(50) yields a string of 50 random nucleotides.
  Forgo this step if using specific data set.
  Returns with random DNA base string of specified range value.
  
Validate String
  All lowercase characters are converted to uppercase.
  Validation loop is used to determine the string is comprised of only valid DNA bases (A, C, G, T) as previously defined in initial Nucleotide command.
  This is highly important if the data set is not introduced as a controlled randomized command, but from hand-transcribed data where human error is introduced.
  Should an unknown value appear (=/= A, C, G, T), the function will return as False.
  
Count Frequency
  Creates dictionary with each defined base starting at 0. Adds 1 for every appearance in string.
  Returns with dictionary frequency count.
